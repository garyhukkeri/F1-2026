## Analysis Dashboards (GitHub Pages)

Interactive analyses built from this data are published at:

**https://garyhukkeri.github.io/F1-2026/**

The landing page lists every dashboard and links to it. Each dashboard is a
self-contained interactive ECharts page for one session (e.g. Monaco GP Race).

### How it works

- Working dashboards live in `visualizations/*.html`.
- `scripts/build_pages.py` scans that folder and generates the published site
  into `docs/` (a landing `index.html` + copies of each dashboard + `.nojekyll`).
- GitHub Pages serves the `docs/` folder of the `gary-main` branch
  ("Deploy from a branch" mode).

### Publish / refresh the site

After adding or updating a dashboard in `visualizations/`, rebuild and push:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_pages.py
git add docs && git commit -m "rebuild pages" && git push origin gary-main
```

The index is regenerated from `visualizations/` on every build, so new analyses
appear automatically — no manual editing of `index.html` required.

### One-time setup

In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, set **Source** to
**Deploy from a branch**, **Branch** to **`gary-main`**, and **Folder** to
**`/docs`**.

What kind of data is available in these repositories? 

Our repositories contain various types of Formula 1 data including:

*   Detailed telemetry data (speed, throttle, brake, DRS)
*   Acceleration data (lateral, longitudinal, vertical)
*   Technical data (RPM, gear, elevation)
*   Race results and qualifying times
*   Lap times and pit stop information
*   Driver and constructor standings

The data is organized by season and follows a consistent format for easy access and analysis.

 Can I use this data for my personal projects? 

Yes, you can use this data as you wish. We encourage creative use of the data for:

*   Data analysis and research
*   Visualization projects
*   Academic work
*   Personal applications

If you publish or share your work, attribution to TracingInsights is appreciated but not required.

 How often is the data updated? 

For current seasons, we typically update the data 30 minutes after each session of a grand prix. Historical seasons are complete and won't receive further updates unless corrections are needed.

 I found an error in the data. How can I report it? 

If you find any errors or inconsistencies in our data, you can:

*   Open an issue on the relevant GitHub repository
*   Contact us through our [contact page](https://tracinginsights.com/contact/)

We appreciate community contributions to improve data accuracy.

 Do I need an API key to access the data? 

No, you don't need an API key. All our data is freely available through the GitHub repositories. Simply:

1.   Clone or download the repository you're interested in
2.   Access the files directly from your local machine
3.   Or use GitHub's raw file URLs in your applications

This approach ensures the data remains accessible to everyone without authentication barriers.
